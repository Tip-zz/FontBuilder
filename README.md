FontBuilder Spreadsheets

These spreadsheets can be used to design bitmapped fonts and produce hex formatted data that can be copied and pasted. These were specifically made for a clock display, so only 15 characters are defined, but you can copy and paste to expand for more characters.

Fonts are created by entering characters into the graphics area at the right side of the sheet. If a cell contains any character the corresponding bit is set, if it is empty the bit is cleared.

These are Excel spreadsheets, but they will also work in Google Sheets. In Sheets the graphics are best with a Column size of 20 pixels.
